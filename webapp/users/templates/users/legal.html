        <center><h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1></center>
        Listing Llama Ltd. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“Listing Llama”) owns and operates this  website (this “Site”) to offer you, the user (“you” or the “User”) an online marketplace platform to connect real estate professionals (each a “Professional User”) and consumers looking to buy or sell real estate (each a “Consumer User”) and related online services (collectively, the “Services”).  Such Services are facilitated through this Site and/or Listing Llama’s web application and all Users must make an account (the “Account”) to access the Services.
        Listing Llama respects your privacy and personal information; this Privacy Policy describes how Listing Llama handles information obtained about Users when visiting this Site. Listing Llama is committed to collecting, maintaining and securing personal information in accordance with the provisions set out herein and all applicable laws.
        Personal Information <br>
        Personal information is any information that directly or indirectly identifies you. It does not include information that is publicly available, as defined by applicable laws.<br>
        The information collected by us depends upon whether you are a Professional User or Consumer Users. 
        However, where permitted by law, non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of Listing Llama’s Internet service or through the use of "cookies" or "Internet tags" and other similar techniques. If you do not want information to be collected through the use of cookies, the onus is on you to turn off this feature on your browser.

        Information respecting device location is collected by the Site, if permission is granted by the User (“Location Information”). This is optional.

        Information about Consumer Users<br>
        When Consumer Users register for the Site and create an Account, they must provide their name, phone number and email address, as well as create a password to access their Account.  Consumer Users who are looking to sell certain real estate are required to provide the address for the property and an approximately estimated value of the real estate. Consumer Users have the option, but are not obligated, to upload pictures of the real estate.
        Information about Professional Users<br>
        When Professional Users register for the Site and make an Account, they must provide their name, license number, and email address, as well as create a password to access their Account. Professional Users must also agree to pay Listing Llama for the Services on a monthly basis and must provide a billing address and credit card information. The billing address and credit care information must be kept updated, as Listing Llama will use this information to invoice the marketing fee, if payable in your jurisdiction.
        Professional Users may opt to upload additional information, including a biography and picture, as well as information about the services the Professional User offers and the locations and jurisdictions the Professional User operates.  
        User Feedback<br>
        Listing Llama may provide a forum for contact and comments, and some Users may choose to provide additional information.   In order to facilitate this, Listing Llama may require certain personal information such as your name and contact information. Listing Llama may explain why this information is necessary, and you agree you have the option to either provide the information or not. Consumer Users may further choose to provide feedback on Professional Users including rating individual Professional Users.<br>
        Usage and Device Information <br>
        Certain information about how Users make use of the Site may also be collected.   This includes:
        How Consumer Users and Professional Users are using the Application, including people and links you interact with, as well as content you access or view and features you use. For example, we collect data related to which properties each Professional User views, and which Professional User profiles each Consumer User views.<br>
        Information respecting which Consumer Users connect with which Professional Users.<br>
        Log data that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or mobile application, including (as applicable) your Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page that you visited before using the Application, your browser type and settings, navigation history and pages requested, the date and time of your use of the Application, information about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences and cookie data.
        Information about the device that you are using the Application on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers, device tokens, and crash data.
        Protection of Personal Information<br>
        Listing Llama collects the personal information in order to facilitate and enhance the functioning of our Site and the Services. Listing Llama takes reasonable steps to ensure that personal data collected is reliable for its intended use, and is accurate, complete and current. Although Listing Llama uses appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect data that pertains to Users from loss, misuse or alteration and takes reasonable steps to ensure that safeguards take into account any known threats, no organization can guarantee the absolute security of personal information and Users agree and understand and are aware that Internet transmissions, particularly email transmissions, are never 100% secure or error-free.<br>
        Consumer User Personal Information Uses<br>
        Property addresses and approximate estimated property values provided by Consumer Users are used to allow Professional Users to see the types of properties that Consumer Users have posted on the Site. The Consumer User’s name and contact information is not posted with the property address and value, and is only provided to a Professional User if the Consumer User elects to connect with that Professional User by accepting that Professional User’s bid (if any) for the provision of real estate professional services (the “Handshake”).
        Property address may also be used by Listing Llama to determine which properties will be displayed to specific Professional Users, based on information provided by Professional Users.
        Consumer User email addresses will also be used to notify Consumer Users of changes to the Site, service information (such as security and fraud notices), and information that may be relevant to them such as changes in market conditions.  Consumer Users can choose not to receive email notifications, or can change their mind at any time by “unsubscribing” (except for service notices).<br>
        Additional information that Consumer Users chose to provide is used only for the purposes that it is collected.  For example, information provided by Consumer Users who contact customer support will be used to respond the Consumer User’s questions or concerns.<br>
        Feedback will be used to assess Consumer User satisfaction with individual Professional Users, and may also be used to identify improper activities by any Professional Users. Ratings provided by Consumer Users may be reviewed and compiled to create an overall rating for each Professional User.<br>
        Professional User Personal Information<br>
        Professional User Personal Information is collected and used for the purpose of allowing Consumer Users to review the services that the Professional Users are offering, in order to make an informed decision about the Professional Users they want to connect with.<br>
        Identity information and license numbers provided by Professional Users are used to verify each Professional User’s identity and to confirm they are real estate professionals that are properly registered and licensed to sell real estate in the relevant jurisdiction.  Listing Llama completes this verification by checking the information provided by the Professional User against publically available databases.
        Listing Llama also uses Professional Users’ email addresses to contact the Professional Users, including to provide information respecting changes to the Site, service information (such as security and fraud notices), and notices of any new features added to the Site. Professional Users may choose not to receive such emails, or can change their mind at any time by “unsubscribing” (except for service notices). 
        Billing address and credit card information will be used by Listing Llama to process monthly membership payments, and for invoicing marketing fees (if applicable).
        Third Party Websites<br>
        If the Site contains links to other third party websites, the owners of those sites are responsible for the privacy practices or content of those other sites. We do not endorse and will not be responsible for the privacy practices on any third party websites.<br>
        Disclosure<br>
        Your personal information may be accessed by or disclosed to Listing Llama’s employees and contractors, business partners, communications and marketing staff, Site development team, and service providers depending upon the information each requires to perform job duties and to optimize the Services and the Site.
        Listing Llama does not authorize Professional Users to use Consumer Users’ information obtained by them through the Site for any purpose except to connect with the Consumer User and to bid for real estate professional services as contemplated by the Site and Services.<br>
        Once a Consumer User has been connected with a Professional User via the Handshake, the Consumer User may provide other personal information to that Professional User at the Consumer User’s sole discretion.   Listing Llama cannot control and is not responsible for the actions of any Professional Users, including the privacy and data protection policies and practices of Professional Users. Please see our Terms of Use [NTD: insert link to website] for more information on this.   
        Listing Llama does not sell any Users’ personal information, or disclose it to any third party marketers.  However, information may be shared or disclosed to third parties in the following circumstances:
        Service Providers<br>
        Currently, the only service providers used by Listing Llama, who may have access to or possession of the personal information that we collect, store and process, are:
        Stripe;<br>
        AWS (Amazon Web Services; and<br>
        Google Analytics for data analytics<br>
        Listing Llama may choose to use service providers in Canada or elsewhere. Personal information of Users may be stored outside Canada, and may be subject to foreign courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in the jurisdiction where it is transferred or stored. By providing Listing Llama with any personal information, Users understand and agree that such personal information may be transferred outside of Canada.
        If Listing Llama engages any third party service providers to do work on the Site or the Services, Listing Llama requires such third parties to have substantially similar protection standards as those used by Listing Llama. Listing Llama further requires the third parties only use you information for uses that have been specifically authorized by Listing Llama prior to disclosure.<br> 
        Business Transactions and Relationships<br>
        From time to time, Listing Llama may enter transactions to sell all or part of its Business or assets, merge with other businesses, or otherwise partner with other businesses. Certain information may be relevant to such transactions or relationships, in which case Listing Llama may disclose this information to other parties involved in the transaction or relationship. 
        Legal Requirements<br>
        Listing Llama may also be required to share personal information with third parties from time to time, without notice or consent, who have not been retained by Listing Llama, when required by law or lawful authority. For example, Listing Llama may be compelled by legal action to release information which includes court order, warrants, statutory reporting obligations, or bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings etc. Listing Llama may disclose personal information without consent to investigate a potential breach of law or contract, to collect on a debt, or in certain emergency situations that threaten the life, health or security of an individual.<br>
        Retention of Personal Information<br>
        Listing Llama will only keep Users’ personal information for as long as is required to be able to use it for the reasons given in this Privacy Policy, and for as long as Listing Llama is required to keep it by law.

You acknowledge that we may change the third party payment service and move your information to other service providers that encrypt your information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or other comparable security technology.<br>
Billing and Cancellation of Professional User’s Membership:<br>
Billing Cycle. The Membership Fee for the Professional Membership and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes, will be charged on a monthly basis to your Payment Method commencing on the date the Professional User Account is created (or at the end of any free trial period) on a pro rata basis, and then subsequently on the first calendar day of each month after the commencement of the paying portion of your Professional Membership. Listing Llama may authorize the Payment Method in anticipation of the Membership Fee or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you create an Account for Professional Membership. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization during a free trial period (if any).<br>
Payment Methods. To use the Listing Llama service, you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "My Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s). You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your Professional Membership in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your Professional Membership, we may suspend your access to the Services until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.<br>
You authorize Listing Llama to use and store any credit card information submitted by you or updated credit card information submitted by your credit card company directly to Listing Llama. If you dispute any charges, you must inform Listing Llama within thirty (30) days upon receipt of Listing Llama's invoice. We reserve the right to change Listing Llama’s prices and/or fees. Your continued use of the Listing Llama Services after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.<br>
Listing Llama may, from time to time, partner with certain third-party payment services (e.g., Masterpass, Visa Checkout, or PayPal, etc.)(each, a "Payment Service") to make the payment process more efficient and streamlined. If any Professional User chooses to use a Payment Service on this Site, the Professional User authorizes Listing Llama to receive and store the payment information associated with use of such Payment Service and to use such payment information in connection with the purchase of the Professional Account and for the automatic monthly Membership Fee. <br>
Cancellation. You can cancel your Professional Account at any time, and you will continue to have access to your Account through the end of your monthly billing period. If the cancellation notice is received by Listing Llama 14 days (inclusive of holidays and weekends) prior to the next billing cycle, the next month will not be billed. To the extent permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial-month membership periods. To cancel, go to the "My Account" page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your Professional Membership, your Account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period.  If you signed up for Listing Llama and provided a third party as a Payment Method (if allowed by Listing Llama from time to time) and wish to cancel your Professional Membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Professional Membership through that third party. You may also find billing information about your Professional Membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party. <br>
Sales Taxes.  For provinces imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase of services may be subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Your purchase of services is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet or by other remote means. Many provinces require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. You may have a tax obligation in provinces even if Listing Llama does not collect sales tax. Details of how to report these taxes may be found at the websites of your respective taxing authorities.<br> 
Listing Llama may not be required by law to collect sales and/or use taxes in all provinces. However, Listing Llama reserves the right to collect sales tax in any jurisdictions if it believes that such collection is required by law.<br>
CONSUMER USERS MAKE CONTACT WITH PROFESSIONAL USERS AT THEIR SOLE DIRECTION. CONSUMER USERS CONTRACT DIRECTLY WITH THE PROFESSIONAL USERS FOR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. LISTING LLAMA IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENTS OR CONTRACTS FOR ANY PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. AS PART OF USING THE SERVICES OR REGISTERING FOR AN ACCOUNT, PROFESSIONAL USERS AGREE TO PAY CERTAIN FEES TO LISTING LLAMA IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES. NONE OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY PROCESSES OR PAYMENTS BY PROFESSIONAL USERS, MAKE LISTING LLAMA RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VERACITY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY USERS’ INFORMATION, CONTENT OR ANY PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.
